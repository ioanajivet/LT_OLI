      <h3>Invitation to participate in the research study <i>My learning dashboard</i></h3>
      <p>We are constantly trying to improve your learning experience while on this platform and to
        better support you in achieving your goals. <b>Through this study, we wish to evaluate the
        impact of a learning analytics feedback tool that offers you personalised feedback on your
        learning progress and learning behaviour.</b> This study is part of a collaboration between 
        Erasmus University of Rotterdam, TU Delft and Open University of the Netherlands.</p>
        <!-- 
          TODO: update text with this being a collaboration between OU/TUD/EUR.
          TODO: add the  -->
      <p>If you wish to participate, <b>we need your permission</b>. Participation is voluntary and it will
        not affect your ability to participate in the course. The study will take place over the whole
        duration of the course meaning that you will have access to the feedback tool until the end of
        the course. Please, note you will not receive any compensation for participating in the study,
        but you will help us advance research in this domain. You can stop your study participation at
        any time without giving a reason by sending us an email (contact details below). Upon your
        request to terminate your participation in the study, you will not have access to the feedback
        tool anymore and we will remove your data from our research dataset.</p>
      <h4>Data collection and processing</h4>
        <p>For this study, we will collect data about:</p>
        <ul> 
          <li>Your interaction with the course activities - we will use this data to generate your
        personalised feedback that will be displayed on the feedback tool.</li>
          <li>Interaction with the feedback tool - we will use this data to analyse when and how the
        tool was used by learners so that we can improve the tool in future iterations.</li>
          <li>Survey answers - At the beginning of the course, we will ask you to answer a
        questionnaire that reflects your self-assessment on self-regulated learning. At the end of the
        course, we will ask you to evaluate the feedback tool used during the course. Filling out
        the surveys will require 10-20 minutes of your time.</li>
          <li>Demographic data - We do not collect this demographic data but we will retrieve it from
        Coursera and include it in our dataset: age, gender, the highest level of education graduated
        and country.</li>
        </ul>
      <h4>Your rights, privacy and security</h4>
        <p>According to the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), you can request the
        deletion of your data. Upon your request, we will remove all your data from the dataset used
        in our research. To exercise this right, please contact the research team before the end of the
        course mentioning your username used on the Coursera platform (contact details below). At the
        end of the course, all collected data will be anonymised, making it impossible to identify you
        within our dataset anymore. The collected data will be used only for research purposes and
        only the research team will have access to the data. Bounded by the GDPR, your personal
        data will not be disclosed or shared with other parties without additional consent. The
        anonymised dataset will be stored for the next ten years as required for scientific research.</p>
        
      <h4>Contact information</h4>
        Please contact us if you have any questions related to your participation in the study.
